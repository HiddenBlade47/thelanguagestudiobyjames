    <h1>What Our Clients Say</h1>

        <p>"Hello everyone! I'm a student of Wesley's (IELTS preparation with native speaker). I would like to thank all the employees / staff of the company, especially my tutor Wesley! I am really glad that I found Wesley who helped me to keep my schedule and to attain solid knowledge. It is great to study languages via Skype, because I can schedule my lessons for any day of the week and for any time of the day (even at 8 o'clock whilst drinking my morning coffee :). It's cool that I study English with Wesley and I am very thankful for his patience and help. Our lessons flow in a free and friendly atmosphere, so I (almost :) don't feel embarrassed and ashamed to speak English in spite of my errors. He always prepares something new and interesting for our lessons. I wish him prosperity and I look forward to further cooperation. Thank you very much!"</p>

        <p>"Last summer I decided to try learning English via Skype. It was my first experience with online learning. I met my teacher- Wesley Hayter and after my demo lesson I felt he should be my teacher. I couldn't imagine that online lessons can be so effective. Wesley performs his work on 100 %. He is not only a professional and energetic teacher, he is also a friendly and positive person who always creates comfortable atmosphere during the lessons. Lessons are created according to my goals. Especially I like that Wesley pays attention to the needful and also difficult themes as 'phrasal verbs', 'idioms' and etc. These things are very necessary in conversational English. After every lesson I get a feedback with notes on grammar errors, pronunciation and also powerful support on achievements in learning. I have been learning English for a few months, but I feel that I have already improved my English noticeably. People around have already noticed it. It is an absolute result of my lessons with Wesley! I love my lessons and I look forward to them! Yours sincerely"</p>

        <p>"Let's just say Wesley's classes aren't for the faint of heart. They're tough. Seriously tough. There were times I wanted to throw my textbook out the window. But... I stuck with it. And I'm so glad I did. I learned so much, and I feel way more confident in my abilities now. So if you're looking for an easy ride, this isn't it. But if you're serious about learning, Wesley will get you there." </p>

        <p>"I wholeheartedly recommend Wesley to any professional seeking to elevate their English communication skills, particularly in the corporate world. My experience working with him has been nothing short of transformative.

When I began coaching sessions with Wesley, I was already proficient in English, but I lacked the confidence and nuance needed to truly excel in my role as a negotiator. I often struggled to articulate complex ideas with precision, and I felt my accent sometimes hindered clear understanding.

Wesley's approach was incredibly personalized and insightful. He immediately identified my strengths and weaknesses, and he designed a tailored program that addressed my specific needs. He didn't just teach grammar rules; he focused on practical communication skills, including advanced vocabulary, persuasive language techniques, and strategies for effective cross-cultural communication.

What truly sets Wesley apart is his dedication and passion for his students' success. He provided constructive feedback, offered invaluable insights into business etiquette, and consistently went the extra mile to ensure I understood and applied the concepts we covered. He was also incredibly patient and supportive, creating a safe space for me to practice and refine my skills without fear of judgment.

The results of my coaching with Wesley have been remarkable. My vocabulary has expanded exponentially, my accent has become clearer and more neutral, and I'm now able to negotiate with confidence and finesse. I can confidently articulate complex proposals, build rapport with international clients, and navigate challenging conversations with ease.

As a direct result of the skills I gained through Wesley's coaching, I've become the most sought-after negotiator in my company. I've secured major deals, strengthened key partnerships, and significantly contributed to the company's bottom line. I'm now recognized as a leader in my field, and I owe a great deal of that success to Wesley's guidance.

If you're looking for a corporate English coach who will empower you to reach your full potential, look no further than Wesley. He's not just a teacher; he's a mentor, a strategist, and a true champion for his students. Investing in his coaching is the best investment you can make in your career."</p>
