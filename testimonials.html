    <h2>What Our Clients Say</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"Hello everyone!
        I'm a student of Wesley's(IELTS preparation with native speaker). I would
        like to thank all the employees / staff of the company, especially my tutor
        Wesley!
        I am really glad that I found Wesley who helped me to keep my schedule
        and to attain solid knowledge. It is great to study languages via Skype,
        because I can schedule my lessons for any day of the week and for any time
        of the day (even at 8 o'clock whilst drinking my morning coffee :)
        It's cool that I study English with Wesley and I am very thankful for his
        patience and help. Our lessons flow in a free and friendly atmosphere, so
        I (almost :) don't feel embarrassed and ashamed to speak English in spite
        of my errors : He always prepares something new and interesting for our
        lessons.
        I wish him prosperity and I look forward to further cooperation.
        Thank you very much!"</p>

      <p>"Last summer I decided to try learning English via Skype. It was my first
        experience with online learning. I met my teacher- Wesley Hayter and after
        my demo lesson I felt he should be my teacher. I couldn't imagine that online
        lessons can be so effective. Wesley performs his work on 100 %. He is not
        only a professional and energetic teacher, he is also a friendly and
        positive person who always creates comfortable atmosphere during the
        lessons. Lessons are created according to my goals. Especially I like that
        Wesley pays attention to the needful and also difficult themes as "phrasal
        verbs", "idioms" and etc. These things are very necessary in conversational
        English. After every lesson I get a feedback with notes on grammar errors,
        pronunciation and also powerful support on achievements in learning. I have
        been learning English for a few months, but I feel that I have already
        improved my English noticeably. People around have already noticed it. It
        is an absolute result of my lessons with Wesley!
        I love my lessons and I look forward to them!
        Yours sincerely"</p>
