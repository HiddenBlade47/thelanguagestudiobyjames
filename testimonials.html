    <h1>What Our Clients Say</h1>

        <p>"Hello everyone! I'm a student of Wesley's (IELTS preparation with native speaker). I would like to thank all the employees / staff of the company, especially my tutor Wesley! I am really glad that I found Wesley who helped me to keep my schedule and to attain solid knowledge. It is great to study languages via Skype, because I can schedule my lessons for any day of the week and for any time of the day (even at 8 o'clock whilst drinking my morning coffee :). It's cool that I study English with Wesley and I am very thankful for his patience and help. Our lessons flow in a free and friendly atmosphere, so I (almost :) don't feel embarrassed and ashamed to speak English in spite of my errors. He always prepares something new and interesting for our lessons. I wish him prosperity and I look forward to further cooperation. Thank you very much!"</p>

        <p>"Last summer I decided to try learning English via Skype. It was my first experience with online learning. I met my teacher- Wesley Hayter and after my demo lesson I felt he should be my teacher. I couldn't imagine that online lessons can be so effective. Wesley performs his work on 100 %. He is not only a professional and energetic teacher, he is also a friendly and positive person who always creates comfortable atmosphere during the lessons. Lessons are created according to my goals. Especially I like that Wesley pays attention to the needful and also difficult themes as 'phrasal verbs', 'idioms' and etc. These things are very necessary in conversational English. After every lesson I get a feedback with notes on grammar errors, pronunciation and also powerful support on achievements in learning. I have been learning English for a few months, but I feel that I have already improved my English noticeably. People around have already noticed it. It is an absolute result of my lessons with Wesley! I love my lessons and I look forward to them! Yours sincerely"</p>
